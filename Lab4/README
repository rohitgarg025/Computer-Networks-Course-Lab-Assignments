Instructions to Compile and Run the code to produce desired output:

1. Compile server File {gcc -o server server.c}
2. Compile client File {gcc -o client client.c}
3. Run the server and client file {./server  ./client}
4. Send message from either terminal to the other.
5. Type exit to exit the client or server program.

If a message is sent when the other program is terminated, the program shows a warning and waits till another run of the program is found to start communicating again.
